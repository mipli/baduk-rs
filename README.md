# SGF Parser

A library used for playing the game of go, or for going through SGF files.

Parses SGF files using [sgf-parser](https://www.crates.io/sgf-parser).

Support all the rules, even though ko checking should probably be tested a bit better. 

Does not yet support counting in any form.

This library is not meant to have a user interface of any kind, so another tool will be coming to ease interaction with the go boards created using `baduk-rs`.
